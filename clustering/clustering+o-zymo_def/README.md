# Clustering analysis workflow works as follows:

1 - Raw tif image analysed with script_image_analysis_AR_V1.m

2 - Folders with images analysed to be compared should be in a parent folder that will be the path indicated in the parameter_analysis.m and do_cluster_analysis_ar.m
scripts to be analysed and compared.

3 - If you want to compare an experiment individually, locate it in a parent folder anyway.

Note: read carefully the different scripts since there are many option to adapt your analysis.
